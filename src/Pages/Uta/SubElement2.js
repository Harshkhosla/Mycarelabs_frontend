    A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common condition that occurs when bacteria enter the urinary system, causing infection in any part of the urinary tract. This includes the kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. UTIs can affect anyone but are more common in women. Symptoms often include a burning sensation during urination, frequent urges to urinate, and cloudy or strong-smelling urine. Left untreated, a UTI can lead to more serious health issues, including kidney infections. Early detection and treatment are key to preventing complications and ensuring a swift recovery.
